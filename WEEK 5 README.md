Some strategies that websites rely on to help get users where they need to go is navigation, chunking, and good link names. Navigation is to "not only show where you can go but also where you are now" (Farrell). With navigation there is many mechanisms to help visitors identify the website and the topics presented on the websites. For example, a mechanism would be navigation change "a  link or graphic element (tab, button, label, etc.) related to navigation becomes more visually prominent when the user selects that topic" (Farrell). Navigation to me is the most important, because without knowing where to go when you get on the first page or you can't figure out how to even find what you are looking for, you will loose interest and leave the website. Another strategy is chunking which "enables easy skimming" (Meyer). Meyer talks about how chunking uses short paragraphs, headings and subheadings that clearly contrast with the rest of the text (bolder, larger, etc., and highlighted keywords (bold, italic, etc.) that helps the visitor know exactly what they are on the website for. The last strategy is good link names, with this it means the names should be straight to the point "home page, contact page, about page, etc". Again it will help the visitor throughout the website, and what they are looking for without having to search for it. Two  informational sites that I visit is worldwildlife.org and Barnes&Noble.com. Although I am just going to be talking about worldwildlife.org,  it is a site that informs people about endangered species, shows the type of work they do, and how you could help. I use the website mostly to read about different animals that are endangered because I think if you don't know about what's going on in the world, we aren't learning. Plus I love animals and would rather read about them than the political or pop culture news. This website is very straight forward and goes along with Redish's "bite, snack, meal approach" (p.134-135).Bite (headline): On worldwildlife.org there are tabs and headlines for each one like "our work, species, places, etc". When you click on each tab sub-headlines appear navigating you throughout the page. Say I picked the species tab, and then picked on elephants, once on the page it gives you more headlines like "overview, why they matter, threats, and etc". So basically this website has great headlines and its applies the bite.Snack (a concise summary): For each headline and sub-headlines there is a summary briefly discussing what you should know about the topic. This website does written summaries, but also has pictures with sentences describe them, making it a little bit less to read and more interesting. It's a good snack.Meal (detail): The detail comes in with the links that they provide that can send you to other articles, stories, publications, and expert pages that better develop the summary or "snack" part.  The detail comes with what the worldwildlife organization is doing for these animals and they provide it clearly on the page. That's when you are done with your meal.
