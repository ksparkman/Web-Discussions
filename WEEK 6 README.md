# Web-Discussions
Redish in these chapters talks about how to have conversation with the visitors of the website, and that is the best way to have good web writing. She mentions certain things to do and not to do when writing for the web. I think each step really does make the writing a little bit better when done correctly. Although i think some steps are more important than others.Headlines are important to make good web writing content because it is "announcing you topic" (p.157). Redish talks about how it will entice and engage people for whom it leads to useful content (p.157). Meaning the headline is what catches the visitor's attention and interest them into reading more. Now there is guidelines to better your headlines, thus bettering the writing. For example, "be clear instead of cute"... Redish talks about how that is likely to fail because the visitors may not connect with the heading or a search engine may not place the article as high in it's results (p.159). Another example is using a "statement, question, or call to action". The statement puts the key message first, the question let the site visitor start the conversation and call to action encourages people to act (p.161). A good heading can make all the difference. It helps not only the visitors(readers) but also the authors. With headings as a reader you are able to "scan to get the gist, find just the section you need and get a quick "bite" of context for each section" (p.165). As a author it will help outline what you are going to write, which is just as important. There is even more guidelines for headings, for example you should "put your site visitors' words in the heading, distinguish headings from text, and help people jump to content within a web page" (p.168). You need to write from your site visitor's point of view, basically write as if you were recording both sides of the conversation. Redish explains this by saying use the word "I" for the site visitor in the question like "How should I prepare?", use the word "you" for the site visitor in the answer, "you may be asked not to eat...", and use the word "we" for organization (p.174). You also need to distinguish headings from the text, although a simple thing it can make the biggest difference. You can bold or even color the heading to make it stand out (p.182). Headings are also great at helping people jump to content by giving you visitors a table of contents of all the headings so each section and be easily found. There are many another examples the Redish used in her book to make web writing good. I want to talk about web writing is different from other kinds of writings, like academic prose, creative writing, professional writing and many more. To me the thing that makes web writing so different is yes it is an informational piece but different audiences get different things out of the information. Web writing is mainly for make sure you are having a conversation with the visitor and it's all about the visitor. There is also variety of different writings. With other writings I don't feel like that is the case. For example with an academic prose you are writing on a certain topic and the one person you are writing to is your teacher. It isn't really a conversation because you are just writing facts in a certain way, with no variety. It is a very uniform style where as web writing you don't have to follow all the rules.
